# DEPRECATED: kraken-tools

[![pipeline

kraken-tools conveniently manages all system requirements for
[kraken-lib](https://github.com/samsung-cnct/kraken-lib). As the base
layer, it contains all necessary and expected dependencies at specific,
tested versions for correct and repeatable operations of kraken-lib and
[kraken](https://github.com/samsung-cnct/kraken).

It is best to perform any work on dependencies and other environment
issues here and let kraken-lib build focus on installing and configuring
the code in the kraken-lib repo.

If you want to use kraken-lib to create a Kubernetes cluster on AWS or
GKE for production or development, use kraken-tools to avoid versioning
and dependency issues. By running kraken-lib inside a kraken-tools
Docker container, your environment will be compliant with kraken-lib's
requirements.

## Prerequisites

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) must be installed on the machine where
you run kraken-tools and your user must have permissions to run it.

## Getting Started

Fork and clone this repo to a local computer and run `docker build .`
from the kraken-tools directory to create a Docker container with the
dependencies to successfully create your cluster.

## Contributing

We welcome all types of contributions from the community and and don't
require a contributor license agreement. To simplify merging, we prefer
pull requests based on a feature branch in your personal fork that's
based off the current master of the repo. For more details, please refer
